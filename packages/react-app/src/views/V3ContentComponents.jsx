## Pool Mechanism
A depositor is committing for "commitment period" and an "initial penalty percent" 
of his choice (within allowed ranges). **After the commitment period the
deposit can be withdrawn with its share of both of the bonus pools**. 
#### Bonus mechanics: "Hold bonus" & "Commit bonus":
The bonus share is determined from the deposit's size, initial commitment, and actual 
holding time relative to other deposits in the pool.
- The two **bonus pools are populated from the penalties for early withdrawals**,
  which are withdrawals before a deposit's commitment period is elapsed. 
  The penalties are split in half and added to both bonus pools (isolated per token): 
  **Hold bonus** pool and **Commit bonus** pool.
- The share of the bonus pools is equal to the share of the bonus points (**hold-points** 
  and **commit-points**) for the deposit at the time of withdrawal relative to the other
  deposits in the pool.
- **Hold points** are calculated as amount of token (or ETH) x seconds held. So **more tokens
  held for longer add more points** - and increase the bonus share. **This bonus is
  independent of commitment or penalties**. The points keep increasing after commitment period
  is over.
- **Commit points** are calculated as amount of token (or ETH) x seconds committed to penalty.
  These points **depend only on commitment time and commitment penalty** 
  at the time of the deposit.
#### Penalty mechanics:
- **Withdrawal before commitment period is not entitled to any part of the bonus**
  and is instead "slashed" with a penalty (that is split between the bonuses pools).
- The **penalty percent is decreasing with time** from the chosen
  initialPenaltyPercent to 0 at the end of the commitPeriod. 
#### Deposit is an NFT (transferrable but immutable):
- Each deposit has a separate ERC721 (NFT) tokenId with the usual transfer mechanics. So
  multiple deposits for same owner and asset but with different commitment
  parameters can co-exist independently.
- Deposits can be deposited for another account as beneficiary,
  so e.g. a team / DAO can deposit its tokens for its members to withdraw.
- Only the deposit "owner" can use the withdrawal functionality, so ERC721 approvals 
  allow transfers, but not the withdrawals.
#### Additional notes:
- Some ERC20 tokens may have fee-on-transfer or dynamic supply mechanisms, and for these
  kinds of tokens this pool tracks everything as "shares of initial deposits".
- **Each token** has **one independent pool**. i.e. all accounting is separate for each token.
- There is no pool creation process - one contract holds all pools.

## Incentives considerations:
All incentives are aligned for longer holding.
- **Commit bonus** (future focused) - rewards committing for higher penalties and longer periods:
  - **Rewards proportionally to their risk (skin in the game)**.
  - Increases the potential bonus - making the pool more attractive.
- **Hold bonus** (past focused) - rewards holding regardless of initial commitment:
  - **Rewards depositors proportionally to their actual past opportunity cost** and reduction
  of tokens in circulation.
  - Even people who are unwilling to commit for a large penalty or period **can
  "earn" bonuses by depositing without withdrawing**.
  - Even after commitment period is over - **holding for longer increases
  the hold-bonus** share relative to future deposits.
  - More **"Whale" resistant** - new large deposits do no affect bonus share
  unless actually held in pool.
- No bonus with penalty: 
  - Incetivises finishing the commitment period.
  - Prevents early withdrawals if bonus is larger than penalty.
- Deferring bonus until withdrawal (no claiming during deposit):
  - Prevents claiming bonus too early and reducing incentive to hold.
  - Reduces bonus for other potential depositors
- Low minimal penalty / commitment period:
  - Allowing more loss-averse depositors to participate.
- Non-zero minimal penalty / commitment period:
  - Preventing no skin in the game situation.

### üí° The idea: "Strong üíé hands" get a bonus from "weak üßÅ hands"'s penalties for early withdrawals.

### ‚ùî Why this may be a good idea:
1. **Price effects** - like "staking", but without the inflation:
    - Makes HODLing more attractive by providing a positive economic incentive ü§ë. 
    - Raises the price by reducing amount in circulation üì•.
    - Builds trust in the asset by proving an amount commited to be held üíç.
1. **Social / network effects** - like "time lock", but with an incentive to participate:
    - Makes HODLing provable and shareable üê¶ .
    - Increases trust in the community's / project team's long term commitment, provides a social incentive to demonstrate "skin in the game" üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è .
1. **Yield generating** - like AMMs LP or lending, but without AMM's impermanent loss and doesn't depend on borrowing demand:
    - Vs. liquidity providing in AMMs: no dependence on trading volume, no exposure to additional assets, no bleeding value to arbitrageurs (~~not-so~~""impermanent"" loss) ü©∏.
    - Vs. lending: earns yield on tokens that don't have a borrowing market with high interest rates üîÑ (or any borrowing market).
1. **Volatility bonus** - market volatility causes higher bonuses:
    - Asset price "moons" ü•≥ - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to take profits, increasing the bonus üí∏.
    - Asset price "tanks" üò¢ - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to panic-sell, increasing the bonus üí∏.`;
