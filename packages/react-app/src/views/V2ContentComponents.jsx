## Pool Rules
- Each token has one independent pool. i.e. all accounting is separate for each token.
- There is no pool creation process - one contract holds all pools.
- Depositor commits for a "commitment period", after which the deposit 
can be withdrawn with any bonus share.
- The bonus pool share is equal to the share of the deposit from all deposits
at the time of withdrawal. E.g. if when you withdraw, the bonus pool is 2 Token, 
total deposits are 10 Token, and your deposit is 1 Token - you get 
0.2 Token ( = 2 * (1 / 10)) as bonus.
- Bonus pool is collected from penalties paid by early withdrawals 
(withdrawals before the commitment period).
- Withdrawal before commitment period does not get any bonus. 
Instead, it is "slashed" with a penalty (that is added to the bonus pool).  
- The penalty percent is decreasing linearly with time from 
"initialPenaltyPercent" to 0 (for the duration of the commitPeriod). 
E.g. if initialPenaltyPercent was 10%, and you withdraw after half the 
commitment period, you get 5% penalty and withdraw 95% of the initial deposit.
- Any additional deposits are added to current deposit, and "reset" the
  commitment period required to wait.
- ERC20 tokens may have fee-on-transfer or dynamic supply mechanisms, and for these
kinds of tokens this pool tracks everything as "shares of initial deposits".`;

### üí° The idea: "Strong üíé hands" get a bonus from "weak üßÅ hands"'s penalties for early withdrawals.

### ‚ùî Why this may be a good idea:
1. **Price effects** - like "staking", but without the inflation:
    - Makes HODLing more attractive by providing a positive economic incentive ü§ë. 
    - Raises the price by reducing amount in circulation üì•.
    - Builds trust in the asset by proving an amount commited to be held üíç.
1. **Social / network effects** - like "time lock", but with an incentive to participate:
    - Makes HODLing provable and shareable üê¶ .
    - Increases trust in the community's / project team's long term commitment, provides a social incentive to demonstrate "skin in the game" üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è .
1. **Yield generating** - like AMMs LP or lending, but without AMM's impermanent loss and doesn't depend on borrowing demand:
    - Vs. liquidity providing in AMMs: no dependence on trading volume, no exposure to additional assets, no bleeding value to arbitrageurs (~~not-so~~""impermanent"" loss) ü©∏.
    - Vs. lending: earns yield on tokens that don't have a borrowing market with high interest rates üîÑ (or any borrowing market).
1. **Volatility bonus** - market volatility causes higher bonuses:
    - Asset price "moons" ü•≥ - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to take profits, increasing the bonus üí∏.
    - Asset price "tanks" üò¢ - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to panic-sell, increasing the bonus üí∏.`;
