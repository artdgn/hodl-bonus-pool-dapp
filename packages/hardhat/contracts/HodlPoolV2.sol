/*
 * @title Token pools that allow different ERC20 tokens and ETH deposits and withdrawals
 * with penalty and bonus mechanisms that incentivise long term holding. 
 * The initial penalty and commitment time are chosen at the time of the deposit by
 * the user.
 * There are two bonus types for each pool - holding bonus (to incetivise holding), 
 * and commitment bonus (to incetivise commiting to penalties & time).
 * Each token has one independent pool. i.e. all accounting is separate for each token.
 * ERC20 tokens may have fee-on-transfer or dynamic supply mechanisms, and for these
 * kinds of tokens this contract tracks everything as "shares of initial deposits". 
 * @notice The mechanism rules:
 * - A depositor is committing for "commitment period" and an "initial penalty percent" 
 *   of his choice (within allowed ranges). After the commitment period the
 *   deposit can be withdrawn with its share of both of the bonus pools.
 * - The two bonus pools are populated from the penalties for early withdrawals,
 *   which are withdrawals done before a deposit's commitment period is elapsed.
 * - The penalties are split in half and added to both bonus pools (isolated per token): 
 *   Hold bonus pool and Commit bonus pool.
 * - The share of the bonus pools is equal to the share of the bonus points (hold-points 
 *   and commit-points) for the deposit at the time of withdrawal relative to the other
 *   deposits in the pool.
 * - Hold points are calculated as amount of token (or ETH) x seconds held. So more tokens
 *   held for longer add more points - and increase the bonus share. This bonus is
 *   independent of commitment or penalties. The points keep increasing after commitment period
 *   is over.
 * - Commit points are calculated as amount of token (or ETH) x seconds committed to penalty.
 *   These points depend only on commitment time and commitment penalty 
 *   at the time of the deposit.
 * - Withdrawal before commitment period is not entitled to any part of the bonus
 *   and is instead "slashed" with a penalty (that is split between the bonuses pools).
 * - The penalty percent is decreasing with time from the chosen
 *   initialPenaltyPercent to 0 at the end of the commitPeriod. 
 * - Any additional deposit is added to the current deposit, carries over commit-points
 *   and hold-points that already actrued, and "resets" the commitment period and penalty
 *   according to the new user choice (but not in a way that will reduce the outstanding 
 *   commitment for the initial deposit).
 *
 * @dev 
 * 1. For safety and clarity, the withdrawal functionality is split into 
 * two methods, one for withdrawing with penalty, and the other one for withdrawing
 * with bonus.
 * 2. The ERC20 token and ETH functionality is split into separate methods.
 * The total deposits shares are tracked per token contract in 
 * depositSums, bonuses in bonusSums.
 * 3. For tokens with dynamic supply mechanisms and fee on transfer all internal
 * calculations are done using the "initial desposit amounts" as fair shares, and
 * upon withdrawal are translated to actual amounts of the contract's token balance.
 * This means that for these tokens the actual amounts received are depends on their
 * mechanisms (because the amount is unknown before actual transfers).
 * 4. To reduce RPC calls and simplify interface, all the deposit and pool views are
 * batched in depositDetails and poolDetails which return arrays of values.
 * 5. The total of a pool's hold points are updated incrementally on each interaction
 * with a pool using the depositsSum in that pool for that period. If can only happen
 * once per block because it depends on the time since last update.
