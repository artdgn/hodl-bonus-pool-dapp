# HODL-bonus-pool 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🤽 dApp 
A small project for learning smart-contract-full-stack-whizz-bang-dApp-buidling with the incredible [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth).

### 💡 The idea
> "Strong 💎 hands" (committed hodlers) get a bonus from "weak 🧁 hands"'s penalties for early withdrawals.

Positive effects:
1. **Price effects** - like "staking", but without the inflation:
    - Makes HODLing more attractive by providing a positive economic incentive 🤑. 
    - Raises the price by reducing amount in circulation 📥.
    - Builds trust in the asset by proving a commitment to hold 💍.
1. **Social / network effects** - like "time lock", but with an upside:
    - Makes HODLing provable and shareable 🐦 .
    - Increases trust in the asset's community / project team by providing a social incentive to "signal" "skin in the game" 🙋‍♀️ .
1. **Yield generating** - like AMMs LP / lending, but without impermanent loss (AMMs) and regardless of borrowing demand:
    - Vs. liquidity providing in AMMs: no dependence on trading volume, no exposure to additional assets, no bleeding value to arbitrageurs (~~not-so~~""impermanent"" loss) 🩸.
    - Vs. lending: earns yield on tokens that don't have a borrowing market with high interest rates 🔄 (or any borrowing market).
1. **Volatility bonus** - market volatility generates higher rewards:
    - Asset price "moons" 🥳 - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to take profits, increasing the bonus 💸.
    - Asset price "tanks" 😢 - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to panic-sell, increasing the bonus 💸.

### Vague versions plan (roadmap? 🧭)
1. v0 (internal)
    - goal: 🚀 end-to-end bare skeleton first version deployed (to testnet). 
    - scope: fixed commitment params, reward by ratio of current pool, only eth
    - stretch scope: erc20 support
    - deliver: repo, tests, deployed contract and frontend for testnet
1. v0.5 (alpha):
    - goal: 🧠 better incentives mechanism, slightly more complex calc and interaction 
    - scope: fixed commitment params, reward by time held, erc20 support
    - stretch scope: contract creation flow + contract
    - deliver: clear UI, FAQ, initial feedback, more testing on testnet
1. v1 (beta): 🍕+🍔 flexible commitment params UI + calc, reward by time held and commitment time
1. v2: 🚢 single contract for all tokens?
