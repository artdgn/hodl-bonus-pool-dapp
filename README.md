# HODL-bonus-pool 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🤽 dApp 
> A project for learning smart-contract-full-stack-whizz-bang-dApp-buidling using the **incredible [austintgriffith/scaffold-eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth)**.

## 💡 The idea: "Strong 💎✊ hands" get a bonus from "weak 🧁 hands"'s penalties for early withdrawals.

### Why would anyone use it, why is it a good idea ❔

1. <details><summary> Price effect: like "staking", but without the inflation </summary>

    - Raises the price by reducing amount in circulation 📥.
    - Builds trust in the asset by proving an amount commited to be held 💍.
    - Makes HODLing more attractive by providing a positive economic incentive 🤑. 

    </details>

1. <details><summary> Social proof / network effects: like "time lock", but with an incentive to participate </summary>

    - Makes HODLing provable and shareable 🐦 .
    - Increases trust in the community's / project team's long term commitment, provides a social incentive to demonstrate "skin in the game" 🙋‍♀️ .

    </details>

1. <details><summary> Yield generating: like AMMs LP or lending, but without AMM's impermanent loss and doesn't depend on borrowing demand </summary>

    - Vs. liquidity providing in AMMs: no dependence on trading volume, no exposure to additional assets, no bleeding value to arbitrageurs (~~not-so~~""impermanent"" loss) 🩸.
    - Vs. lending: earns yield on tokens that don't have a borrowing market with high interest rates 🔄 (or any borrowing market).

    </details>

1. <details><summary> Volatility bonus: market volatility causes higher bonuses </summary>

    - Asset price "moons" 🥳 - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to take profits, increasing the bonus 💸.
    - Asset price "tanks" 😢 - more "weak hands" will withdraw early to panic-sell, increasing the bonus 💸.

    </details>

1. <details><summary> So what tokens this should / shouldn't be used for? </summary>

    - ✔️ Most tokens which don't have profitable AMM / staking / lending usage.
    - ✔️✔️ Community driven tokens like meme-tokens.
    - ✔️✔️✔️ Smaller (new) project tokens instead of time-lock mechanism .
    - 👎 Stablecoins: they can be profitably and safely lended, or provided as liquidity in AMMs.
    - 👎 Tokens which have very high trading volume but don't change in price much: they can be LPed in AMMs.
    - 👎 Tokens which have profitable staking mechanisms: they can be staked for guaranteed yield.

# Local development

System dependencies: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

## Running local chain + contract + local frontend
1. Install dependecies: `yarn install`
1. Start a local chain: `yarn chain`
1. In second terminal: deploy the contract to the chain - `yarn deploy` or `yarn watch`
1. In third terminal: start the frontend react server `yarn start`

## Testing:
- All tests: `yarn test`
- Run some tests matching a pattern (in their description strings):
  1. Go to contracts package: `cd packages/hardhat`
  2. Start a local chain: `yarn chain`
  3. In second terminal: run e.g. "deployment" related tests - `yarn mocha -g deployment`
